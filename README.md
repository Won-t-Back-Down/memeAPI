# memeAPI

Welcome to Meme4Me, an API for memes!

The premise for the project is that it will be an "Instagram for memes". 
Once registered and logged in, users will be able to view, upload, edit, and/or delete memes to a database that will be shared with other users.
Users can also filter/search for memes based on a variety of tags.

Admin accounts can ban users from the platform and delete inappropriate memes.
