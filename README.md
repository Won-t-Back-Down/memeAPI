# memeAPI

Welcome to Meme4Me, an API for memes!

The premise for the project is that it will be an "Instagram for memes". 
Once registered and logged in, users will be able to view, upload, edit, and/or delete memes to a database that will be shared with other users.
Users can also filter/search for memes based on a variety of tags.

Authorized admin accounts can ban users from the platform and delete inappropriate memes.

How to build and run the project:
  - Clone the git repository
  - In the terminal go to the cloned repository's directory and run the following commands:
    - npm install
    - npm run seed
    - npm run server-start
  - The server should now be running!
  
The API is deployed on https://meme4me.onrender.com

Here is the documentation of example HTTP requests that our API accepts:
